# 3DReconstructionSPL
3D Reconstruction from Single Photon Lidar data using Compressed Sensing

This is the code repository corresponding to work done for my thesis to achieve MSc. in Computer Vision and Robotics.

The files containing "test" in the name can be run to test the project with corresponding data.

The rest of the files are all useful functions to run the code.

Please read the thesis document or the presentation for details about the project.
